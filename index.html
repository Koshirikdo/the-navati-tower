            <h2>What is the Navati Tower?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The so-called Navati Tower (named after its current owner, Manuel Navati) is a breathtaking tower in the city centre of Piacenza, Emilia-Romagna. Its story goes all the way back to the 12th century, when Imelda Amazonis Colombus, an ancestor of Christopher Columbus, had a Church built, where citizens could enjoy arts, beside religion. So the St. Matthew's Church was established in 1106, and throughout the years, the church became a theater, and its clock tower became a home for many artistic souls. It housed Pier Paolo Pasolini, Federico Fellini, Alberto Moravia, and so many others. So please come visit us and see what these prolific personalities have left behind, while enjoying a view of the whole town from the upmost floor and having a drink in our lounge.</p>
